    "question": "What is the coverage for personal accident?\n",
    "true_answer": "The coverage for personal accident is \u00a310,000.",
    "source_doc": "https://www.zurich.co.uk/-/media/business/documents/car/720525.pdf",
    "generated_answer": "The coverage for personal accident is provided in Document 3 for Part A Private Car Insurance under Section 1 Liability to others. It covers legal liability for death, injury, or property damage caused by the use of the insured's car or trailer being towed by it. The coverage applies to the policyholder, named drivers, passengers, employers/business partners, and their legal representatives if they have passed away. Legal representation is provided for coroner's inquests, court proceedings, and charges of manslaughter, causing death by dangerous driving, causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving, or causing serious injury by dangerous driving. However, there are exclusions for certain types of accidents, such as those caused by a fault in the insured's car, disputes related to loans, mortgages, pensions, investments, or borrowing, and disputes over the sale, purchase, terms of a lease, license, or tenancy of land or buildings. It should be noted that the policy does not cover legal costs and fees for these excluded accidents.\n\nIn addition, Document 4 provides coverage for legal costs and fees up to \u00a3100,000 for each accident, subject to prior approval from DAS and the purpose and amount of expenses being agreed upon. Before legal proceedings are issued, DAS will appoint a legal representative to act on behalf of the policyholder. If legal proceedings need to be issued, the policyholder may choose their own legal representative, but DAS's approval is required. If the policyholder and DAS cannot agree on a legal representative, DAS will ask the Law Society to choose one, which both parties must accept. It is a condition of this cover that the policyholder takes all reasonable precautions to reduce legal costs and fees.\n\nLastly, Document 6 provides optional coverage for accidental damage and personal possessions, as well as family legal expenses. However, there are exclusions for handheld computers and mobile phones, as well as events such as theft, malicious damage, and escape of water if the home is unoccupied for over 60 days. Vehicles and craft are also excluded from coverage.\n\nIn summary, the coverage for personal accident is provided for death, injury, or property damage caused by the use of the insured's car or trailer being towed by it, subject to certain exclusions.
